# Angular_project
This project demonstrates the power of Angular and JSON Server in building dynamic, data-driven web applications. 
This Angular project is a Single Page Application (SPA) that provides a smooth user experience by dynamically updating the webpage with new data from the server, without requiring a full page reload. It’s built using Angular, a powerful framework for building complex web applications.

The project uses JSON Server for its backend. JSON Server is a simple tool that lets you set up a RESTful API in seconds. It’s based on a JSON file which acts as a database for the application. This allows the Angular application to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the data stored in the JSON file.

The Angular application communicates with the JSON Server API using HTTP requests. It uses Angular’s HttpClient module to send these requests and receive responses from the server. The application can create new entries in the database, read existing entries, update entries, and delete entries, all through the JSON Server API.

The project is structured using Angular’s component-based architecture. Each part of the application is encapsulated in a component, which includes a TypeScript class for the component’s logic, an HTML template for the component’s view, and a CSS file for the component’s styling.
